# NeoVim

## Install for Ubuntu 20.04
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable
sudo apt update
sudo apt install neovim
```

## Current
The Neovim config that I currently use.

Nvchad is a good project, but it have toooooo many backwards compatibility breaks in a short period of time. (including some changes I don't like :P)
So, I use Nvchad and other configurations as references to create my own configuration. XD
